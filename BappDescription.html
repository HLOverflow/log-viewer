<p>Logs is a BurpSuite extension to work with log files.</p>

<p>With this simple extension you will be able to load Burp's log files into Burp, and perfom actions like sending a specific request to the Repeater to perform further attacks or analysis.</p>

<p>Under Project Options &gt; Misc &gt; Logging, there are options to log every HTTP request and response made and received by Burp. Logging can be configured per-tool or for all Burp traffic.
    This can be useful to keep complete records of your sessions.</p>
